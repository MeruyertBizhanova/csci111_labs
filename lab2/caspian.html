		<p align="center" style="color: white"> In <strong>1963</strong>, the settlement of Aktau received town status. The city is a major oil and gas production center, and is known for
		<br> its unique heated oil pipeline. Galleries of petroglyphs from the age of nomads (10th-2nd centuries B.C.) have been found 
		<br>on great mounds in the heart of the peninsula, as well as a necropolis with grave markers decorated with complex ornamentation.
		<br>Two ancient underground mosques, built a thousand years ago, were discovered near <strong>Ungazy</strong> mountain.
		<br>The most interesting of these two is Shahbagota mosque, because though Islam banned the portrayal of people or their
		<br>body parts, on the walls of this mosque, surrounded by lotus blossoms, is a painting of a man’s palm.
