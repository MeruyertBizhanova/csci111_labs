		<p align="center" style="color: white"> In <strong>1963</strong>, the settlement of Aktau received town status. The city is a major oil and gas production center, and is known for
		<br> its unique heated oil pipeline. Galleries of petroglyphs from the age of nomads (10th-2nd centuries B.C.) have been found 
		<br>on great mounds in the heart of the peninsula, as well as a necropolis with grave markers decorated with complex ornamentation.
		<br>Two ancient underground mosques, built a thousand years ago, were discovered near <strong>Ungazy</strong> mountain.
		<br>The most interesting of these two is Shahbagota mosque, because though Islam banned the portrayal of people or their
		<br>body parts, on the walls of this mosque, surrounded by lotus blossoms, is a painting of a man’s palm.

		  	Mangyshlak used to be called a “land that has lost water”. Now it is called a “land that has found water”. Aktau city (former Shevchenko, named after Ukrainian poet) has quenched the thirst of the desert. Aktau is the only city in the world that lives entirely on sea water that has been desalinated with the help of a nuclear reactor.

			The water-desalinating plant evaporates tens of thousands of cubic meters of salty Caspian water daily, turning it into a distillate which is used for producing potable and industrial water. Only one third of the nuclear power plant’s capacity is used for generating electricity, the rest being used for desalinating seawater.

			Aktau city is open to the cool summer breezes blowing from the sea while at the same time being protected from desert heat coming from the east. Consequently, a rather mild marine climate has formed here in Aktau.

			But how much work, effort and means have gone into this land! To plant a tree, jack hammers had to be used for drilling the earth instead of ordinary spades, and to cover the roots, soil and seaweed had to be brought here from a distance of hundreds of kilometers. And the green plants had to be watered day after day for many years before they would take root and begin to grow.

			In 1978 International Union of Architects awarded the group of Aqtau city planners who had worked out the general layout of Aqtau city the prize named after the outstanding urban planner Leslie Patrick Abercrombie.

		  	Aktau is only a little more than <strong>40</strong> years old, but it already has everything necessary for a normal life. Thus Aktau has several cultural centers, a concert hall, cinemas and dozens of libraries, gyms and sports grounds. One may stroll Aqtau city streets for hours on end, admiring the architectural ensembles, green alleys lined with poplars and acacias, emerald-green lawns and a park.

			Aqtau also has a botanical garden where plants from various parts of Kazakhstan are getting acclimatized. Today in Aqtau city there are over 25 square meters of greenery per resident, which is above the national average.
